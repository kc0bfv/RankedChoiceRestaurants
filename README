Dependencies:
    Python 3 - this is 2016, so we use Python 3
    Django - developed with 1.10
        pip3 install django
    mysqlclient - Only if you're using mysql as your database
        pip3 install mysqlclient

Deploying:
    Run "./GenerateConfig.py" to generate a config file at the location specified in RankedChoiceRestaurants/settings.py
    Change PRODUCTION to True in RankedChoiceRestaurants/settings.py
    Run "./manage.py collectstatic" to copy all static files into the directory specified in GenerateConfig.py
    Run "./manage.py makemigrations" voting to prime the migrations
    Run "./manage.py migrate" to create the necessary database entries
    Run "./manage.py createsuperuser" to create the django administration user
    Run "./manage.py createanonymous" to create an anonymous user for non-logged-in polling
    Run "./manage.py check --deploy" if you want to auto-check django security settings.  SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS is the only normal warning - you'd have to setup HSTS to get rid of that warning.
    
    If you're using passenger on Dreamhost, create a link to passenger_wsgi.py in your web server's directory.  Directory structure should look like:

    vote.notmet.net
    | passenger_wsgi.py
    | ...
     \RankedChoiceRestaurants
      | passenger_wsgi.py
      | README
      |\RankedChoiceRestaurants
      | | settings.py
      | | ...
      |\voting
      | | ...
